Hashicorp is a fantastic company. They have fantastic documentation, and there is plenty of content out there for Terraform. Why should I write this blogpost about the different object types in Terraform? 

When I begun using Terraform, I was not sure what the "data" object represents. Maybe you are looking up what the data object is. If you start using Terraform, this guide here may come handy to you.

Additionally, I want to keep a reference on what all the Terraform objects are and how to use them. So this might also be useful to you. 

### resource


### data


### output


### locals
